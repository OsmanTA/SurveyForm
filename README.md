# SurveyForm

For this project I created a survey using both HTML and CSS. To open the survey, download both SurveyFormHTML and SurveyFormCSS, save each file as a HTML and CSS file respectively. When saving the CSS file rename it to "styles.css" or change the reference to the CSS file in the HTML code. Once opened, you will be prompted with a short survey that has a variety of questions with radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, and textboxes.
